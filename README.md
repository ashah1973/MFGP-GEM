# MFGP-GEM
Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process Model based on Graph Embeddings for Molecules.

This repository provides python codes and data for the paper 

"Rapid high-fidelity quantum simulations using multi-step nonlinear autoregression and graph embeddings", by A.A. Shah, P.K. Leung, W.W. Xing, to appear in npj Computational Materials

The uploaded code implements the method for the Alexandria data set, which is also uploaded (see the paper). I will add other examples, data sets and machine learning/multi-fidelity comparison codes soon.
